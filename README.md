# Sales-Insight-Power-BI-Dashboard
This project focuses on developing an ETL process within a database and designing a Power BI dashboard to analyze AtliQ Hardware's sales data. The goal is to conduct an in-depth analysis of sales data and identify key sales activities that will drive profit and boost revenue generation for the company.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware is a business which supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many of the clients across India. The sales director is facing challenges in dynamically tracking the sales moreover he is facing challenges in understanding the business insights. The company currently relies on phonecalls to regional managers to relay the business insights. This is not reliable since the results are based on verbal communication that is unreliable. There is numerous data present in excel files and it is quite difficult to obtain insights by manually looking through the multiple sales data files.

## Insights
- Revenue Trend: There has been a notable decline in revenue over the years with the minimum revenue generated in 2020.
- Delhi NCR region had the highest revenue of 77.73M in 2020 which is but 0.59% profit margin.
- Bhubaneswar region had a revenue of 0.16M in 2020 but yet was the highest profit generator. It had a profit margin of 10.48%
- Our Top 3 Customers are  Excel Stores, Surge Stores and Electricalsara with a contribution to the profit of 12.5%, 11.9% and 11.9% respectively for the year 2020.
- Delhi NCR has been the greatest contributor to the profit margin however in the year 2020 it came in second with a contribution of 22.13% while Mumbai was the highest contributor with 23.89%

## Recommendations based on insights
- From the revenue insights in 2020, Bhubaneswar region generated the highest revenue therefore it is advisable to have more target marketing in the region, increase discount offers and possible open more stores since it has a promising rate of return on investment.
- Based on the observation on revenue contributions for the year 2020, Mumbai was the greatest contributor to the profit margin. . As a result, I would advocate expanding sales strategy that have proven successful in Mumbai to other regions in order to increase profits.
- Delhi NCR is the greatest revenue contributor however when it comes to profit it comes in second therefore an investigation of expenses that would be resulting to reduction in profit needs to be done.
- Customer tiers can be created based on the contribution to the profit margin and therefore have target marketing incentives based on the customer tier, this will maximize returns on investments.
